Implementations of concepts common in technical interviews

## why?

I want to improve my technical interviewing skills. One reason is they're weak.

I called it bouncer because these concepts, and coherent implementations ( and understanding ) of them, are the status quo gatekeepers to access to working at many companies in the capacity of programmer / engineer, or related roles.

Whether or not these are the "right" or "fair" metric does not matter to me. They are what is. So they are what must be prepared if my goal is to get offers from such companies ( and to feel I made the most of my opportunity to interview with them ). And maybe by doing well at these in a technical interview, I can also have some fun.

## Implemented

- Hash table (insert, delete, update, search) [DONE!]
- Linked list (insert, delete, update, search) [DONE!]

## To Implement

- Graph (insert, delete, update, search ( bfs, dfs ))
- List (insert, delete, update, search ( binary search on sorted ), sort ( quick sort, merge sort ))
- 2D arrays (insert, delete, update, search)
- Dynamic arrays (insert, delete, update, search, resize ( allocation strategy ))
- Binary search tree (insert, delete, update, search)
- Algorithm: dynamic programming ( memorization )
- Algorithm: branch and bound 
- Concept: Big-O (in function comments do Big-O for each function, also write BigO function to instantiate and test and discover experimental and round to "rought" order coefficient)
